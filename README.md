# UFO Analysis Challenge 11

## Overview of Project

The premise of this project was to provide Dana with a website using JavaScript that she could post her UFO article and relevant information on. This website was designed to be capable of presenting stunning visualizations to readers and to allow visitors of her website to search a table containing UFO sightings through the use of multiple filters. This task was performed using JavaScript version ES6+ and CSS, the usage of JavaScript functions (arrow functions, for loop functions, etc), and by creating an HTML that was populated with all necessary information and a dynamically filterable table using JavaScript. Please see below for the analysis deliverables. 

- Deliverable 1: Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria

- Deliverable 2: A written report on the UFO analysis (README.md)

## Analysis Results

Well, the first action item in order to properly produce a search using Dana's new website would be to thoroughly look the table and find the selective criteria and values one would like to use and search for. The second action would be to write down the values on a piece of paper or separate document. This is due to the fact that the table will update immediately once a change is detected and the user will either have to look through the table again for the other values they desire or guess the values (probability of misspelling or forgetting value resulting in no information presented on the table). Lastly, the third and final action item would be to input the desired values into the correct input fields. If everything is properly entered and nothing is misspelled, the user should successfully derive the results they are searching for. 

## Summary 

One significant drawback of this webpage is the dynamically filtered table. While the idea and principle of the filters are great, it does not provide the user time to thoroughly view the results before the code detects a change and follows through with its procedure. In such a case where the user is searching for a specific result and forgets/misspells the second filter value they are trying to apply. This resulting in nothing being found within the table or the user having to search the table again to find the value for the second filter. Thus, my first recommendation would be to bring back buttons. One to perform the action of filtering through the results and another to reset the filters applied. The second recommendation would be to advance the code to search for multiple items in a single filter search. For example, selecting the states California and Oregon and getting table results back presenting the relevant information from both.
